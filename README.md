Welcome to the Daily Coding Problems repository! Within this collection, you'll discover a variety of daily coding challenges designed to both test and enhance your programming proficiency.
- [**Problem 01-Two Sum Problem**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-01) - Given an array of integers and a target, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target.
  
- [**Problem 02-Remove Duplicates from sorted array**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-02) - Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

- [**Problem 03- Remove Element from List**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-03) - Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

- [**Problem 04- Search Insert Position**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-04) - Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

- [**Problem 05- Plus One**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-05) - You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.
Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

- [**Problem 06- Pascal's Triangle**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-06) - Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.
In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
 
 - [**Problem 07- Merge Sorted Array**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-07) - You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

- [**Problem 08- Single Number**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-08) - Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

- [**Problem 09- Majority Element**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-09) -Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

- [**Problem 10- Pascal's Triangle II**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-10) -Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown

- [**Problem 11- Summary Range**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-11) -You are given a sorted unique integer array nums.A range [a,b] is the set of all integers from a to b (inclusive). Return the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly. That is, each element of nums is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer x such that x is in one of the ranges but not in nums.

- [**Problem 12- Missing Number**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-12) -Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

- [**Problem 13- Move Zeroes**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-13) -Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
