Welcome to the Daily Coding Problems repository! Within this collection, you'll discover a variety of daily coding challenges designed to both test and enhance your programming proficiency.
- [**Problem 1-Two Sum Problem**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-1) - Given an array of integers and a target, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target.
  
- [**Problem 2-Remove Duplicates from sorted array**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-2) - Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

- [**Problem 3- Remove Element from List**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/blob/main/Problem-3/README.md) - Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

- [**Problem 4- Search Insert Position**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-4) - Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

- [**Problem 5- Plus One**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-5) - You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.
Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

- [**Problem 5- Plus One**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-5) - You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.
Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

 
 - [**Problem 7- Merge Sorted Array**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-7) - You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

- [**Problem 8- Single Number**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-8) - Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

- [**Problem 9- Majority Element**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-9) -Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
