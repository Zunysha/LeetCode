Welcome to the Daily Coding Problems repository! Within this collection, you'll discover a variety of daily coding challenges designed to both test and enhance your programming proficiency.
- [**Problem 1-Two Sum Problem**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-1) - Given an array of integers and a target, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target.
  
- [**Problem 2-Remove Duplicates from sorted array**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-2) - Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

- [**Problem 3- Remove Element from List**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/blob/main/Problem-3/README.md) - Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

- [**Problem 4- Search Insert Position**](https://github.com/Zunysha/LeetCode/tree/main/Problem-4) - Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
