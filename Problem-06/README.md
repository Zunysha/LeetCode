# **Problem:**
Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
# **Examples:**
## Example 1:

Input: numRows = 5
Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]
## Example 2:

Input: numRows = 1
Output: [[1]]
 

# **Constraints:**

1 <= numRows <= 30
# **Solution:**
## Intuition

1. **Class Definition:**
   - The code defines a class named `Solution`.

2. **Method Definition:**
   - Within the class, there is a method named `generate` that takes the number of rows `numRows` as input.

3. **Initialize Empty List:**
   - Inside the method, an empty list `tri` is initialized. This list will store the rows of Pascal's triangle.

4. **Generate Rows:**
   - A loop runs for `numRows` iterations, representing each row of Pascal's triangle.

5. **Initialize Each Row:**
   - For each iteration, a new row is created as a list with `(i + 1)` elements, all initialized to `1`. This represents the initial values of each row.

6. **Calculate Values Inside the Row:**
   - A nested loop is used to calculate the values inside each row (excluding the first and last elements) by summing the corresponding values from the previous row. This follows the property that each element in Pascal's triangle is the sum of the two elements directly above it.

7. **Append Row to Triangle:**
   - After the row is calculated, it is appended to the `tri` list.

8. **Return Result:**
   - The method returns the list of lists representing Pascal's triangle.

9. **Instance and Example Usage:**
   - An instance of the `Solution` class is created, and the `generate` method is called with `numRows` set to `5`.

The result of calling `generate(5)` would be the first 5 rows of Pascal's triangle stored in the variable `tri`. The intuition is similar to the previous code explanations, where each row is built by adding the two values directly above it in the previous row.

## Complexity
Certainly! Let's discuss the time and space complexity of the given code:

### Time Complexity:
- The outer loop runs `numRows` times, iterating through each row.
- The inner loop runs for each position in the row, but it excludes the first and last positions, so it runs at most `i - 1` times for each row.
- Inside the loops, basic operations like list initialization and element assignments take constant time.

The time complexity can be expressed as O(numRows^2) since the inner loop runs in a nested fashion.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is determined by the storage of Pascal's triangle in the `tri` list.
- For each row `i`, a new list of size `(i + 1)` is created.
- Therefore, the space required for the entire triangle is the sum of the sizes of all rows up to `numRows`, which is proportional to the sum of the first `numRows` natural numbers.

The space complexity is O(numRows^2), dominated by the storage of Pascal's triangle.
