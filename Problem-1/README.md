**Problem:**

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of two numbers in the array such that their sum equals the target. You can assume that each input has exactly one solution, and the same element cannot be used twice. The order of the returned indices does not matter.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

**Constraints:**

- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
- Only one valid answer exists.
