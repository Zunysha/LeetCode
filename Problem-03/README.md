# **Problem:**
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

 # **Examples**

## Example 1:

- Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
- Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
- Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

## Example 2:

- Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
- Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
- Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 

# Constraints:

- 0 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 50
- 0 <= val <= 100

# Solution:
# Intuition
This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `removeElement` that takes a list of integers `nums` and an integer `val`. The goal is to remove all occurrences of the specified value `val` from the list `nums` and return the new length of the list after removal.

Here's the step-by-step explanation of the code:

### Class Definition:
```python
class Solution(object):
```
This line defines a class named `Solution`.

### Method Definition:
```python
def removeElement(self, nums, val):
```
This method is defined within the class. It takes two parameters: `nums` (a list of integers) and `val` (the value to be removed).

### Initialization:
```python
x = len(nums)
i = 0
```
`x` is initialized with the initial length of the list `nums`, and `i` is set to 0 for the loop counter.

### While Loop:
```python
while i < len(nums):
```
This initiates a `while` loop that continues as long as the index `i` is less than the current length of the list `nums`.

### Condition Check:
```python
if nums[i] != val:
    i += 1
```
If the element at index `i` in the list is not equal to the specified value `val`, increment the index `i`. This skips elements that are not equal to the value to be removed.

### Else Block:
```python
else:
    nums.pop(i)
    x = x - 1
```
If the element at index `i` is equal to the specified value `val`, remove that element from the list using `pop(i)`. Also, decrement `x` by 1 to update the length.

# Approach
This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `removeElement` that takes a list of integers `nums` and an integer `val`. The goal is to remove all occurrences of the specified value `val` from the list `nums` and return the new length of the list after removal.

Here's the approach of the code:

### Initialization:
```python
x = len(nums)
nums_copy = nums[:]
```
- `x` is initialized with the initial length of the list `nums`.
- `nums_copy` is created as a shallow copy of `nums` using slicing (`nums[:]`).

### For Loop:
```python
for num in nums_copy:
```
- The code uses a `for` loop to iterate through each element in the shallow copy `nums_copy`.

### Condition Check:
```python
if num == val:
```
- If the current element `num` is equal to the specified value `val`, it enters the block.

### Element Removal:
```python
nums.remove(num)
x = x - 1
```
- Removes the element `num` from the original list `nums` using the `remove` method.
- Decrements `x` by 1 to update the length.

### Print Updated List:
```python
print(nums)
```
- Prints the updated list after removal.

### Return Updated Length:
```python
return x
```
- The method returns the updated length of the list after removing the specified value.

### Test Case:
```python
nums = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 4, 2]
val = 2
instance = Solution()
k = instance.removeElement(nums, 2)
print(k)
```
- Creates an instance of the `Solution` class.
- Calls the `removeElement` method with the provided `nums` and `val`.
- Prints the updated length of the list after removal.

The overall approach involves creating a shallow copy of the list to iterate over while modifying the original list. It removes elements equal to the specified value, updates the length, and prints the updated list. The final length of the list is then returned.

# Complexity
Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the given code:

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the code depends on the number of elements in the `nums` list. Let `n` be the length of the list.

- The `for` loop iterates over each element in `nums_copy`, which is a shallow copy of the original list. The worst-case scenario is that every element is equal to the specified value `val`.
- In each iteration of the loop, the `remove` method is called, and it may take up to O(n) time in the worst case because it needs to find the first occurrence of the specified value in the list.

The overall time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case, where `n` is the length of the list.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the code is influenced by the additional space used for the shallow copy of the list.

- The `nums_copy` list is created using slicing (`nums[:]`). The space required for `nums_copy` is O(n), where `n` is the length of the list.
- Other than the shallow copy, the algorithm doesn't use any additional space that scales with the input size.

The overall space complexity is O(n) in the worst case.

In conclusion, the given code has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(n). The time complexity could be improved by using a different approach that doesn't involve removing elements from the list in each iteration, leading to a more efficient algorithm.
